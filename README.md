## Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of recommendation algorithms, focusing on three key approaches:

1. **Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)**
   - A powerful latent factor model that decomposes user-item interactions to uncover hidden patterns in movie preferences
   - Uses Bayesian inference to handle sparse data and provide probabilistic predictions
   - Enables scalable recommendations for large user bases

2. **Collaborative Filtering Approaches**
   - **User-based**: Identifies users with similar tastes to recommend movies they've enjoyed
   - **Item-based**: Finds movies with similar characteristics based on user ratings
   - Implements multiple similarity metrics for robust recommendation accuracy

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Comprehensive evaluation of algorithm performance using industry-standard metrics
   - Parameter tuning to optimize recommendation quality
   - Comparative analysis to identify the most effective recommendation strategies

## Key Features

- Multi-algorithm comparison framework
- Advanced visualization capabilities
- Performance metrics analysis
- Parameter optimization tools
- Scalable architecture for large datasets

## Dataset

The project uses the MovieLens dataset, which contains movie ratings from real users. The dataset includes:
- User ratings for movies
- Movie metadata
- User demographics
- Timestamps of ratings

## Setup Instructions

1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Download the MovieLens dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)
   - Place the `ratings_small.csv` file in the project's root directory

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Create a virtual environment (recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
     ```
   - Install required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Implemented Algorithms

The project implements and compares three main recommendation algorithms:

1. **Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)**
   - A latent factor model that decomposes the user-item rating matrix
   - Uses probabilistic approach to handle missing data
   - Provides probabilistic predictions of user preferences

2. **User-based Collaborative Filtering**
   - Finds similar users based on their rating patterns
   - Recommends items that similar users have liked
   - Supports multiple similarity metrics:
     - Cosine similarity
     - Mean Squared Difference (MSD)
     - Pearson correlation

3. **Item-based Collaborative Filtering**
   - Finds similar items based on user ratings
   - Recommends items similar to what the user has liked
   - Also supports multiple similarity metrics
